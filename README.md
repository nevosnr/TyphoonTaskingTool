## The project : A Comparison Between Low/No-Code Paradigms and Traditional Coding Through Frameworks
This is an ASP.NET Core project for my final module studying towards a BSc(Hons) Computer Science. It is a 'simple' Service Management tool bespoke to the requirements of my organisation built predominantly using built in frameworks through .Net Core,
Entity Framework Core, Blazor and addtionally using an external library MudBlazor for UI components to provide a modern look and feel to the application.

A full stack solution using C# was choosen as I have experiance with C#, mainly through the use of the Unity Engine. I am intending to pivot my current career goals to fit within a C# domain and as such following successful completition of the Academci
elements this project will iterate into a portfolio piece to demonstrate my skills.

ASP.Net Core 9.0 is being utilised for backend connection to a SQL Express Database. Aside from deviations detailled in the academic report it is predominantly boilerplate create code from a Blazor template on
Visual Studio Community edition 2022.

Problems were resolved in the traditional manner - favouring search endgine results and stack overflow. No LLMs, local or cloud based were used in the creation, iteration and delivery of this artifact.

## Built with:

- C# (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)
- ASP.NET 9.0 (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-9.0)
- Blazor (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-9.0)
- MudBlazor (https://mudblazor.com)
